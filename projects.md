Working on a few projects

### DNS Update API:
REST based api for making ns updates to multiple DNS servers. Authentication will be paramount and tsig will be utilized for secure communication between api and dns servers. Planning on writing this in Go. 

### Hardware burn-in tool:
Looking to build a tool that will be used to automate the burn-in of hardware. This tool will run a gamot of tests against the hardware over the course of hours to days and will report back stats on how the burn-in tests were going.
